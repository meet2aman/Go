## 📚 Why I'm Learning Go

Go is a modern, fast, and statically typed language developed at Goovgle, known for:

- High performance
- Concurrency support
- Clean and simple syntax
- Great for backend, cloud, and system programming

## 💼 Companies Using Go in Production

Go is trusted by some of the biggest tech companies in the world for its **speed**, **scalability**, and **simplicity**.
